# MedicalCenter
Console application used for booking medical appointments.
The project had to include functionalities introduced in the more recent versions of C++.
I decided to use:
- smartpointers,
- map, 
- iterator. 
## Getting Started 
Unfortunately the app works only on Windows, bad like for the unix based systems.
To test MedicalCenter just download our repo and run the code in your IDE. In case of enormous number of weird errors try to change Target Platform Version to your available one in project properties.
**Project->Properties->Configuration Properties->General->Target Platform Version**

Rarely Platform Toolcase also requires modification.  
## Running the app
### Main Menu
Successfully compiled code should look like this, use arrows to choose option from the menu and confirm it with enter button.
